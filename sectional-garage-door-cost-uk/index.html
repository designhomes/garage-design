<p>Made up of individual sections and connected by hinges sectional garage doors simply rise vertically up tracks and back into the roof space of your garage. Due to the construction of sectional garage doors in that they open vertically upwards and are suspended under the ceiling they provide maximum space inside and in front of the garage. Operation is by an integrated smart technology remote control motor the CarTeck Drive. Non-insulated and insulated sectional garage doors are generally fitted onto the rear of the brickwork opening to maximise drive-through width and height.
