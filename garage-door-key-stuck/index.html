<p>When a key is stuck in a pin-tumbler lock what that usually means is that one of the pins has dropped down into the keys cuts but isnt lifting back out of the way so the key can be withdrawn. Others have a simple slide lock on the inside left or right hand side of door. If you happen to have some spray lubricant in the car or the garage you can its no problem. Next start by spraying the lock and stuck key liberally with the lubricant to loosen all components.
