<p>I resetted them but still no power. It means if you overloaded the garage circuit say running a saw and dust collector and the saw hangs up on a knot then the breaker that would trip is not in your main panel. If you have a multi meter check the circuit breaker for voltage even if it doesnt look tripped. Either i have the wrong breaker or there is a hidden junction box somewhere behind the wall.
