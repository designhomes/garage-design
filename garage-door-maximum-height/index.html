<p>There is actually a standard on the height of the sensor at the garage door and for good reason - set the sensor too far up and a small child can be caught under the door even with an otherwise fully operational safety system. For sectional garage doors there are many standard UK sizes offered which use the same principal of 6 increments in the width starting at 70 wide and usually only 2 heights of 66 and 70 although manufacturers like Carteck offer a far wider range of standard heights with their UK sized sectional doors.

If you are having a new garage built theres a good chance that the builder will suggest a door 9 feet wide and 7 feet highassuming you are planning one door for each vehicle in the garage. 250 mm minimum is recommended.</p>
