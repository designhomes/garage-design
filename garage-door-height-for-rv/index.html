<p>Since you are already going with a 16 high ceiling see previous paragraph it doesnt make any sense to use a 12 tall door. For my van this new opening needed to be 103 inches high. When open it takes a foot of ceiling room and does not block overhead lighting as the door covers only 13 12 feet and rv garages are at least 40 feet deep. Herb needed at least 125 feet to stuff his rig in the garage. Schweiss Photo Of The Day Crazy Cool Rv Garage Door Garage Construction Rv Garage Garage Doors.</p>
