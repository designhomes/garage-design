<p>A belt drive garage door opener is supposed to run smoothly and silently but when its motor starts to give way you may notice squeaking sounds coming from the opener. Make sure the brackets holding the rollers are tight. The belt should still have a little slack when the door is closed. Its possible that this is happening because of stretch on the loaded side of the belt. Ace 7 5 In L Silver Steel Anti Sag Gate Kit 1 Pk Ace Hardware.</p>

<p>New garage door opener belt sags when opening. If you find your garage door operator is the source of the noise and you choose to replace it we recommend a steel-reinforced rubber belt drive system as these are usually less noisy than the typical chain-drive system. Does the other side sag when lowering the door. 47 out of 5 stars. Pat Rippon Author At Garage Doors Residential Garage Doors Garage Door Service Martinez 925 357 9781.</p>
