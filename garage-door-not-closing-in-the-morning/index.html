<p>You cant leave the house with the garage door open. We purchased a garage door with keypad from Sears and have noticed that when the door itself is in the direct sunlight - late morning all the way until late afternoon you have to hold down the button on either the keypad or the button inside the garage by the door to the house until the garage door is all the way down - or else it will act like there is something in the way and start to close but then go. When there is an issue with your safety sensors the opener will interpret this as an obstruction and refuse to close the door. If the issue is with the sensors youll likely find that you can use the garage door remote or wall-mounted switch to open the door but not to close it.
