<p>Someone suggested spraying PAM on the edge of the door after I spray it. The garage door tech explained that this results from latex paint which is partially on the back side of the weather stripping rubber that gets really tacky in the heat and direct sun. Closing and reopening the door shortly thereafter does not produce the same problem as the weather seal has had not had time to stick again. One way to prevent paint stickiness is to place wax paper between the door and the door jamb.

<p>Second as we mentioned earlier make the environment as conducive as possible to your paint drying. Let the paint cure well and then spray a little silicone on the area that is sticking. Let it dry as long as possible first of course Ive painted a door first thing in the morning let dry as long as possible during the day before closing fully only to find the paint stuck and pull off on the weather stripping the next morningdeflating moment.
